    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</p></li>
